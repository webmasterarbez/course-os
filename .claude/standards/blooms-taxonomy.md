# Bloom's Taxonomy - Complete Reference

Bloom's Taxonomy is a hierarchical classification of cognitive learning objectives. Use it to design learning outcomes that are measurable and appropriately challenging.

## The 6 Cognitive Levels

### Level 6: Create (Highest)

**Definition:** Produce new or original work by combining elements in novel ways.

**Action Verbs:**
- Design, construct, develop, formulate, build
- Compose, create, devise, generate, invent
- Plan, produce, assemble, author

**Example Outcomes:**
- "Design a complete marketing funnel for a SaaS product"
- "Develop a testing strategy for a microservices architecture"
- "Build a responsive web application from scratch"

**Assessment Methods:**
- Capstone projects
- Original creations
- Portfolios
- Business plans

---

### Level 5: Evaluate

**Definition:** Make judgments based on criteria and standards.

**Action Verbs:**
- Judge, critique, assess, defend, recommend
- Evaluate, appraise, argue, justify, validate
- Prioritize, rate, support, conclude

**Example Outcomes:**
- "Evaluate the effectiveness of different pricing strategies"
- "Critique a UX design based on usability heuristics"
- "Assess security vulnerabilities in a codebase"

**Assessment Methods:**
- Case analysis
- Peer reviews
- Recommendations
- Comparative essays

---

### Level 4: Analyze

**Definition:** Break material into constituent parts and determine relationships.

**Action Verbs:**
- Compare, contrast, examine, differentiate, distinguish
- Analyze, deconstruct, organize, attribute, outline
- Categorize, correlate, diagram, dissect

**Example Outcomes:**
- "Analyze user behavior patterns to identify drop-off points"
- "Compare and contrast REST and GraphQL architectures"
- "Examine the components of an effective sales funnel"

**Assessment Methods:**
- Case studies
- Comparative analysis
- Diagnostic exercises
- Root cause analysis

---

### Level 3: Apply

**Definition:** Use information in new situations to solve problems.

**Action Verbs:**
- Implement, execute, use, demonstrate, apply
- Operate, practice, solve, illustrate, employ
- Calculate, complete, interpret, schedule

**Example Outcomes:**
- "Implement authentication using OAuth 2.0"
- "Apply the SOLID principles to refactor legacy code"
- "Execute a customer interview using the Jobs-to-be-Done framework"

**Assessment Methods:**
- Hands-on exercises
- Simulations
- Lab work
- Problem sets

---

### Level 2: Understand

**Definition:** Explain ideas or concepts; construct meaning.

**Action Verbs:**
- Explain, describe, summarize, interpret, classify
- Discuss, distinguish, estimate, extend, generalize
- Infer, paraphrase, predict, report, translate

**Example Outcomes:**
- "Explain how OAuth 2.0 authorization flow works"
- "Describe the difference between unit and integration tests"
- "Summarize the key principles of lean startup methodology"

**Assessment Methods:**
- Explanatory writing
- Discussion boards
- Concept maps
- Teach-back exercises

---

### Level 1: Remember (Lowest)

**Definition:** Recall facts and basic concepts.

**Action Verbs:**
- Recall, list, define, identify, name
- Recognize, locate, describe, retrieve, label
- Match, memorize, repeat, state

**Example Outcomes:**
- "List the HTTP status codes and their meanings"
- "Identify the key components of a marketing funnel"
- "Define the terms API, REST, and JSON"

**Assessment Methods:**
- Multiple choice quizzes
- Matching exercises
- Fill-in-the-blank
- Flashcards

## Writing Effective Learning Outcomes

### The Formula

```
"Learners will be able to" + [ACTION VERB] + [SPECIFIC CONTENT] + [CONTEXT/CONDITIONS]
```

### Good vs. Bad Examples

| Bad (Vague) | Good (Specific) |
|-------------|-----------------|
| "Understand marketing" | "Explain the 4 Ps of marketing and give examples of each" |
| "Know how to code" | "Implement a REST API endpoint with error handling" |
| "Learn about testing" | "Design a test suite that covers unit, integration, and e2e tests" |

### SMART Criteria

Ensure each outcome is:

- **S**pecific - Clear and unambiguous
- **M**easurable - Observable and assessable
- **A**chievable - Realistic for the learner level
- **R**elevant - Connected to course goals
- **T**ime-bound - Achievable within course duration

## Mapping Outcomes to Assessments

| Bloom's Level | Best Assessment Types |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Create | Projects, portfolios, original work |
| Evaluate | Case analysis, peer review, critiques |
| Analyze | Comparative essays, case studies, diagnostics |
| Apply | Hands-on exercises, simulations, problems |
| Understand | Explanations, discussions, summaries |
| Remember | Quizzes, matching, fill-in-the-blank |

---

## Course Level Guidelines

| Course Level | Primary Bloom's Focus |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Beginner | Remember, Understand, Apply |
| Intermediate | Understand, Apply, Analyze |
| Advanced | Analyze, Evaluate, Create |
| Expert | Evaluate, Create |
