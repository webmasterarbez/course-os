## Key Questions
1. Primary target learner?
2. What do they know BEFORE?
3. What should they know AFTER?
4. Why would they take this course?
5. What constraints do they face?
6. How do they prefer to learn?

## Persona Structure

- Goals (primary, secondary, timeline)
- Motivations (intrinsic, extrinsic)
- Constraints (time, budget, obstacles)
- Preferences (format, style, pace)
- Objections & responses

## Outputs
- `specs/personas.yaml` (2-3 personas)
- `specs/positioning.yaml`
- `specs/learner-journey.yaml`
- `specs/accessibility.yaml`
- `.course-os/research/competitors.yaml`

## Quality Gate
□ 2-3 personas created
□ Competitor analysis (3-5)
□ Positioning defined
□ Journey mapped
□ Accessibility considered
